    "Turning once again, and this time more generally, to the question of invasion, I would observe that there has never been a period in all these long centuries of which we boast when an absolute guarantee against invasion, still less against serious raids, could have been given to our people. In the days of Napoleon, of which I was speaking just now, the same wind which would have carried his transports across the Channel might have driven away the blockading fleet. There was always the chance, and it is that chance which has excited and befooled the imaginations of many Continental tyrants. Many are the tales that are told. We are assured that novel methods will be adopted, and when we see the originality of malice, the ingenuity of aggression, which our enemy displays, we may certainly prepare ourselves for every kind of novel stratagem and every kind of brutal and treacherous manœuvre. I think that no idea is so outlandish that it should not be considered and viewed with a searching, but at the same time, I hope, with a steady eye. We must never forget the solid assurances of sea power and those which belong to air power if it can be locally exercised.\n",

At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty's Government – every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation.

Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \\n \\n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \\n \\n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \\nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and as sured her that \\nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'GPL Ghostscript 8.15', 'creator': 'PScript5.dll Version 5.2', 'creationdate': 'D:20070730160943', 'moddate': 'D:20070730160943', 'title': 'Microsoft Word - Document1', 'author': 'Shri', 'source': 'paper/apjspeech.pdf', 'total_pages': 7, 'page': 1, 'page_label': '2'}, page_content='for it to achieve before 2020. This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo.

      "O texto destaca a aspiração da juventude indiana por um país desenvolvido, refletindo o desejo de 540 milhões de jovens por uma Índia próspera e segura. O autor compartilha sua experiência em Nagaland, onde encontrou conselhos de aldeia empoderados, discutindo o progresso local e a necessidade de melhor conectividade física para facilitar o transporte de produtos. Ele enfatiza a transformação que pode ocorrer em 600.000 vilas da Índia se forem empoderadas e bem conectadas. Além disso, menciona a iniciativa do Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, que implementa o complexo PURA em 65 vilas, promovendo conectividade física, eletrônica e de conhecimento, resultando em geração de empregos e empreendedorismo.\n",
      "\n",
      "O texto destaca a geração de emprego e a criação de empreendedores com o apoio ativo de 1000 grupos de autoajuda. Duascentas acres de terras improdutivas foram transformadas em terras cultiváveis, onde os moradores cultivam Jatropha, plantas medicinais e geram energia a partir de biomassa, além de processar alimentos e operar centros de comercialização. Esse modelo promove um desenvolvimento econômico sustentável na região. Nos últimos oito meses, as comunidades das vilas Periyar PURA, com apoio do Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women e da Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO), desenvolveram protótipos competitivos de 55 produtos. Essa colaboração aumentou a capacidade inovadora das 65 vilas, contribuindo para a produção de produtos aceitos internacionalmente. O país precisa de 7000 PURA para reduzir a desigualdade rural-urbana.\n",

      "Recentemente, tive a oportunidade de conhecer mais de 6000 agricultores de diferentes estados e territórios da União no Rashtrapati Bhavan. Eles demonstraram grande interesse pelos Jardins Mughal, Jardins Herbais e outros, interagindo com especialistas em horticultura. Durante um simpósio nacional, resumi sugestões práticas dos agricultores para dobrar a produção agrícola com menos recursos. A agricultura é a base da nação, e devemos empoderar os agricultores para uma segunda revolução verde. Acredito que, com a parceria entre agricultores, cientistas e indústrias, podemos aumentar o crescimento do PIB agrícola em pelo menos 4% ao ano. Além disso, tive uma experiência tocante ao conhecer SR Krishna Murthy, um homem sem braços e pernas, que irradiava felicidade e gratidão.\n",

      "O texto relata a experiência de um cantor talentoso, que, apesar de suas limitações físicas, expressa seu desejo de cantar e inspirar os outros. Ele se apresentou com a canção \"Entharo Mahanubavulu\" de Saint Thyagaraja, tocando o narrador e demonstrando que, com atitude positiva e perseverança, é possível superar desafios. Em julho de 2007, ele se apresentou no teatro de arte do Rastrapati Bhavan. Além disso, o autor compartilha sua visita à vila de Urusa, em Jammu e Caxemira, após o terremoto devastador de 2005. Ele elogia a coragem dos moradores, que, com o apoio das Forças Armadas e do governo, enfrentaram suas dificuldades e se tornaram mestres de suas próprias situações.\n",
      "\n",
      "As crianças e os membros da vila participaram bravamente da operação de socorro com as Forças Armadas, sorrindo durante a visita. A escola estava funcionando em tendas temporárias, e o Chefe de Justiça Interino de Jammu e Caxemira, junto com autoridades estaduais, ajudou na distribuição de ajuda aos vítimas do terremoto. Em 2005, durante uma visita às Ilhas Car Nicobar, percebi a coragem dos habitantes locais, que acolheram as vítimas do tsunami de 2004 como seus próprios filhos, sem orfanatos na região. Comovido, escrevi o poema \"Sea Waves\", que foi cantado por todos, demonstrando coragem e entusiasmo apesar do sofrimento. Além disso, mencionei minha participação no Parlamento Pan-Africano em 2004.\n",
      "\n",
      "Na África, 53 países membros da União Africana participaram de uma proposta para o conceito de Rede Pan-Africana e-Network, que visa conectar os países africanos por meio de uma rede integrada de satélite, fibra óptica e wireless, com um custo estimado de US$ 100 milhões. O projeto incluirá 12 universidades (7 da Índia e 5 da África), 17 hospitais superespecializados (12 da Índia e 5 da África), 53 centros de telemedicina e 53 centros de teleeducação na África. Um projeto piloto de teleeducação e telemedicina já foi iniciado na Etiópia, com a Universidade Nacional Aberta Indira Gandhi oferecendo um curso de MBA para 34 estudantes etíopes. Especialistas do Hospital CARE também estão envolvidos na telemedicina.\n",

      "Desde novembro de 2006, Hyderabad oferece teleconsultas ao vivo de uma hora para médicos no Black Lion Hospital, em Addis Ababa, nas áreas de Cardiologia e Radiologia. Utilizando a rede Pan-Africana, os chefes de Estado de 53 países estarão conectados para comunicação instantânea, promovendo a transformação social na África com a experiência indiana em tecnologia. O autor expressa orgulho ao visitar o Siachen Glacier, o submarino INS Sindhurakshak e voar em um caça Sukhoi-30, destacando a dedicação das Forças Armadas. Ele também interagiu com forças de segurança e parou para reconhecer o trabalho dos cidadãos que promovem o desenvolvimento da juventude, como a Fundação Lead India 2020, em Hyderabad.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Fundação Lead India 2020, criada por Dr. N.B. Sudershan em Hyderabad, está treinando milhares de estudantes em vários distritos de Andhra Pradesh, em parceria com a Administração Distrital. O impacto do treinamento é visível, especialmente no distrito de Medak, onde os alunos demonstram maior autodisciplina, amor pelos pais e professores, superação do medo de palco e reconhecimento de seus deveres cívicos. Um exemplo é a estudante Padma, que ajudou seu pai a parar de fumar após participar do programa. Com 540 milhões de jovens abaixo de 25 anos, é essencial empoderá-los por meio de educação baseada em valores e liderança. O texto destaca a diversidade cultural e a unidade da Índia, refletindo a riqueza de suas tradições.\n",
      "\n",
      "O texto destaca a importância de preservar a rica e diversificada cultura e civilização do país, mesmo enquanto se busca o crescimento econômico. É um dever para as futuras gerações, que deve ser realizado com a participação de várias instituições. O autor expressa confiança de que a Índia pode se tornar uma nação desenvolvida antes de 2020, impulsionada pela força de seus 540 milhões de jovens. Ele convoca os cidadãos a trabalhar em prol de uma Índia desenvolvida, com um perfil que inclui a redução da divisão rural-urbana, acesso equitativo à energia e água, colaboração entre setores, educação acessível e a atração de talentos. A mensagem final é de esperança e determinação para alcançar esses objetivos.\n",
      "\n",
      "O texto descreve a visão de uma nação ideal, onde todos têm acesso ao melhor atendimento médico. A governança é caracterizada por ser responsiva, transparente e livre de corrupção. A pobreza e a illiteracia foram completamente erradicadas, e não há crimes contra mulheres e crianças, garantindo que ninguém se sinta alienado. A nação é próspera, saudável, segura, pacífica e feliz, mantendo um caminho de crescimento sustentável.\n",

Ele expressa seu orgulho em viver em uma nação que é um dos melhores lugares para se viver e destaca sua missão de conectar os corações e mentes de um bilhão de pessoas em uma sociedade multicultural. Kalam enfatiza a importância da autoconfiança e a crença de que \"podemos fazer isso\". Ele se compromete a estar ao lado dos cidadãos na grande missão de tornar a Índia uma nação desenvolvida até 2020. O discurso termina com uma bênção e a saudação \"Jai Hind\".\n",

He emphasizes key messages for India's future, such as accelerating development, empowering villages, enhancing agricultural growth, overcoming challenges through collaboration, and fostering a youth movement for a developed India by 2020. He recalls a poignant moment with a young girl who asked why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020, highlighting the aspirations of the youth as a driving force for progress. He appreciated her thoughtful question and assured her that her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation, emphasizing a commitment to work towards that vision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam shares his experiences visiting villages, such as Khuza village in Nagaland, where he witnessed empowered village councils making decisions for their development. He stresses the importance of providing physical connectivity to rural areas and highlights initiatives like the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which aims to enhance rural development through urban amenities and connectivity, ultimately leading to economic growth and employment opportunities. He notes the successful transformation of 200 acres of wasteland into cultivable land, where villagers engage in sustainable practices such as cultivating Jatropha, herbal and medicinal plants, and food processing, supported by 1,000 self-help groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, he discusses the collaboration between the Periyar PURA villages and the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO), which has led to the development of internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products, enhancing the innovative capabilities of the villagers. Kalam emphasizes the need for 7,000 such PURA initiatives across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, underscoring the importance of agricultural growth as the backbone of India's development. He also shares his enriching experience of meeting over 6,000 farmers at Rashtrapati Bhavan, who expressed keen interest in various gardens and engaged with horticultural specialists. He highlights the necessity of doubling agricultural production while conserving resources and empowering farmers for a second green revolution, confident that collaboration between farmers, agricultural scientists, and industries can significantly boost agricultural GDP growth.\n",

      "Kalam recounts a touching encounter with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a man with disabilities who radiated positivity and gratitude, illustrating the resilience of the human spirit in overcoming challenges. He was moved by Krishna Murthy's desire to share his musical talent despite his physical challenges, showcasing how encouragement from family and community can help individuals thrive. Furthermore, Kalam reflects on the indomitable spirit of the people of Jammu & Kashmir, particularly after the devastating earthquake in 2005, where he witnessed the courage and resilience of the villagers in Urusa, who, with the support of the Army and Air Force, became masters of their challenges rather than allowing those challenges to define them. He recalls how children and villagers participated bravely in relief operations, maintaining their spirits even in temporary shelters, and highlights the collaborative efforts of local authorities in providing immediate support to earthquake victims.\n",

Through these experiences, Kalam underscores the importance of connectivity and societal transformation as essential components for India's progress.\n",

The project includes connecting 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa), 17 super specialty hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa), and establishing 53 telemedicine and tele-education centers across Africa. A pilot project on tele-education and tele-medicine has already been commissioned in Ethiopia, with the Indira Gandhi National Open University offering MBA courses to Ethiopian students. Additionally, since November 2006, Hyderabad has been providing one-hour live tele-consultations to doctors in Black Lion Hospital, Addis Ababa, in Cardiology and Radiology, further showcasing the benefits of technology in fostering societal transformation in Africa.

He acknowledges the contributions of para-military forces and police personnel in ensuring the safety and security of citizens.
